### Atmospheric River
Atmospheric River is a narrow band of water vapor flowing at a rapid speed in the upper level of the atmosphere. It can generate extreme rainfall when obstructed by an elevated landform and the vapor gets condensed. In this study, we have investigated the presence of Atmospheric River during the extreme rainfall in Cherapunjee, Meghalaya that created severe flooding in the downstream of Bangladesh. 

#### Data Used
Integrated Vapor Transport, Wind Speed, and Geopotential Height at the pressure level of 500 hPa from ECMWF ERA5 Reanalysis with an interval of 6 hours.
